# make shure Python knows where to look for the RUEDI Python code
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4580101/python-add-pythonpath-during-command-line-module-run
# Example (bash): export PYTHONPATH=~/ruedi/python

# import ruediPy classes:
from classes.rgams		import rgams

# connect to MS, then turn off filament:
MS        = rgams( serialport = '/dev/serial/by-id/pci-WuT_USB_Cable_2_WT2016234-if00-port0' , label = 'MS_MINIRUEDI1', max_buffer_points = 1000 )
MS.filamentOff()
print 'Filament current: ' + MS.getFilamentCurrent() + ' mA'

# Wait to exit:
input("Press ENTER to exit...")
