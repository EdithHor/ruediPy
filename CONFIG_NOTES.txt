*** Configure Python path
Python needs to know where to look for the RUEDI Python code. On Linux, you can tell Python to look in ~/ruedi/python/... by setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable. With the BASH shell, this is achieved by typing "export PYTHONPATH=~/ruedi/python" in the command line terminal. To avoid typing this command every time, it's much easier to just add the command to the ~/.bashrc file, so the command is executed every time you log in to the shell.


*** Accessing USB/Serial adapters using consistent device names
(see also http://askubuntu.com/questions/49910/how-to-distinguish-between-identical-usb-to-serial-adapters)

In Linux, plugging USB/serial adapters in and out or rebooting the computer may change their device labels under /dev/ttyUSB*. For instance /dev/ttyUSB3 may change to /dev/ttyUSB4, so it's not a good idea to write measurement scripts using these identifiers.

Using USB/serial adapters with unique serial numbers or IDs really helps (the WuT adapters work well)! This allows accessing the USB/serial adapters by using their serial numbers or IDs as shown in this example:

1. Find the USB/serial adapters by ID:
> ls /dev/serial/by-id/
pci-WuT_USB_Cable_2_WT2304837-if00-port0
pci-WuT_USB_Cable_2_WT2350938-if00-port0
(...and some other devices that are irrelevant here...)

2. Access the USB/serial adapters like this:
MS    = rgams('RGA-MS','/dev/serial/by-id/pci-WuT_USB_Cable_2_WT2304837-if00-port0')
VALVE = selectorvalve('INLETSELECTVALVE','/dev/serial/by-id/pci-WuT_USB_Cable_2_WT2350938-if00-port0')
