\ruediPy\ is a collection of Python programs for instrument control and data acquisition using RUEDI instruments \citep{Brennwald:2016a}. \ruediPy\ also includes some GNU Octave (or Matlab) tools to load, process, and manipulate RUEDI data acquired with \ruediPy\ Python classes.\par

\section{Overview}
\ruediPy\ is a collection of Python programs for instrument control and data acquisition using RUEDI instruments. \ruediPy\ also includes some GNU Octave (or Matlab) tools to load, process, and manipulate RUEDI data acquired with \ruediPy\ Python classes. The RUEDI instrument itself is described in a separate document\citep{Brennwald:2016a}.\par

The Python classes for instrument control and data acquisition are designed to reflect the different hardware units of a RUEDI instrument, such as the mass spectrometer, selector valve, or probes for total gas pressure or temperature. These classes, combined with additional helper classes (e.g., for data file handling), allow writing simple Python scripts that perform user-defined procedures for a specific analysis task.\par

The GNU Octave tools (m-files) are designed to work hand-in-hand with the data files produced by the data acquisition parts of the Python classes. \work{expand this: load raw data, process / calibrate data, etc.}

\ruediPy\ is developed on Linux and Mac OS X systems, but should also work on any other system that run Python and GNU Octave.

\section{Obtaining and installing \ruediPy}
\ruediPy\ can be downloaded from \url{http://brennmat.github.io/ruediPy} either as a compressed archive file, or using Subversion or Git version control systems. \ruediPy\ can be installed to just about any directory on the computer that is used for instrument control -- but the user home directory  (\path{~/ruediPy}) may seem like a sensible choice, and that's what is assumed throughout the examples shown in this manual.

As an example, here's a step-by-step list of instructions to install \ruediPy  on a Linux computer running Ubuntu 16.04 (the user account name in this example is \tt{brennmat}):
\begin{enumerate}


\item Update system software to latest versions and install basic software requirements for \ruediPy:

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade
> sudo apt-get install subversion python-pip python-serial python-matplotlib python-scipy
> pip install pydigitemp


\item Download ruediPy:

> svn co https://github.com/brennmat/ruediPy.git/trunk ~/ruediPy


\item Permanently add ruediPy to the users Python searchpath (this requires the user to log out and log back in to become active):

> echo export PYTHONPATH=~/ruediPy/python >> .profile

\item Prepare directory for ruediPy data files:

> mkdir ~/ruedi_data

\item Set permission for using the serial ports (this requires the user to log out and log back in to become active):

> sudo usermod -a -G dialout brennmat


\item Prepare directory for ruediPy data files:

> mkdir ~/ruedi_data

\item Log out and log back in to make the above changes active.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Python classes}
\subsection{Overview}
The Python classes are used to control the various hardware units of the RUEDI instruments, to acquire measurement data, and to write these data to well-formatted and structured data files.\par

Currently, the following classes are implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{rgams\_SRS.py}: control and data acquisition from the SRS mass spectrometer
\item \texttt{selectorvalve\_VICI.py}: control of the VICI inlet valve
\item \texttt{pressuresensor\_WIKA.py}: control and data acquisition from the WIKA pressure sensor
\item \texttt{datafile.py}: data file handling
\item \texttt{misc.py}: helper functions
\end{itemize}


The Python class files are located at \path{~/ruediPy/python/classes/}. To make sure Python knows where to find the \ruediPy\ Python classes, set your \texttt{PYTHONPATH} environment variable accordingly.\footnote{A convenient method to achieve this on Linux or similar UNIXy systems is to put the following line to the \texttt{.profile} file: 
 \texttt{export PYTHONPATH=\path{~/ruediPy/python}}}

These classes are continuously expanded and new classes are added to \ruediPy\ as required by new needs or developments of the RUEDI instruments. The various methods / functions included are documented in the class files. Due to the ongoing development of the code, it seems futile to keep an up-to-date copy of the methods / functions documentation in this manual. Please refer to the detailed documentation in the class files directly.
